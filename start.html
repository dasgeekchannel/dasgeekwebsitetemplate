    This is a community of geeks with a common goal of filling our brains. This community is meant for sharing and exploring new ideas and passions with fellow geeks of all kinds from around the world. Since ignorance has no place in a community of brain expanding geniuses we accept 'all' people without exception. This is a place of peace of learning. Not a safe place where your ideals won't be challenged but rather a place where you can teach and be taught. Make friends, be kind, be thoughtful and add to the conversations. Name calling and trolling is great for 4chan or Reddit but will not be tolerated here. Here we learn. Here we teach. Here we grow our brains. 
    
    Welcome to the geeks only club.
